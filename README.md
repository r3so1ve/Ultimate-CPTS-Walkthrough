# Ultimate-CPTS-Walkthrough
This repository will encompass all Hack The Box Academy modules of "Certified Penetration Testing Specialist" job role path. 
Here you will find everything that will help you to ace your CPTS exam, including all walkthroughs of all modules, all skills assessments, as well as some tips and most useful commands and techniques which I use myself. 
Although the HTB CPTS job role path consists of 28 modules, I also included some additional ones, which in my opinion will help get better understanding of the whole process and cover all topics. 
Here is what a layout of modules looks like, divided into phases of a real penetration test:
### Introduction & General Knowledge:
1. Penetration Testing Process
2. [02. Getting Started](/HTB-Academy/Getting%20Started.md)

7. Introduction to Active Directory
8. Introduction to Web Applications

### Reconnaissance, Enumeration & Attack Planning
10. Network Enumeration with NMAP
11. Footprinting
12. Information Gathering - Web Addition
13. Vulnerability Assessment

This path can be adjusted according to your level of knowledge and previous experience. If you are a complete beginner, I think that this path is just for you. If you are an advanced specialist, you can skip some introduction modules where necessary. Also, if you conduct a black box pentest, then you can swap Exploitation & Lateral Movement and Web Attacks modules, as in black box pentest you only have some IP addresses, domains and usually you start by testing web application and exploiting vulnerabilities there, which then, will give you access to the internal part (Active Directory as an example)
