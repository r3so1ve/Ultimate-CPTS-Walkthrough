# Pivoting Tunneling, and Port Forwarding

During a `red team engagement`, `penetration test`, or an `Active Directory assessment`, we will often find ourselves in a situation where we might have already compromised the required `credentials`, `ssh keys`, `hashes`, or `access tokens` to move onto another host, but there may be no other host directly reachable from our attack host. In such cases, we may need to use a `pivot host` that we have already compromised to find a way to our next target. One of the most important things to do when landing on a host for the first time is to check our `privilege level`, `network connections`, and potential `VPN or other remote access software`. If a host has more than one network adapter, we can likely use it to move to a different network segment. Pivoting is essentially the idea of `moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments`.

There are many different terms used to describe a compromised host that we can use to `pivot` to a previously unreachable network segment. Some of the most common are:

- `Pivot Host`
- `Proxy`
- `Foothold`
- `Beach Head system`
- `Jump Host`

Pivoting's primary use is to defeat segmentation (both physically and virtually) to access an isolated network. `Tunneling`, on the other hand, is a subset of pivoting. Tunneling encapsulates network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through it. Think of it like this:

We have a `key` we need to send to a partner, but we do not want anyone who sees our package to know it is a key. So we get a stuffed animal toy and hide the key inside with instructions about what it does. We then package the toy up and send it to our partner. Anyone who inspects the box will see a simple stuffed toy, not realizing it contains something else. Only our partner will know that the key is hidden inside and will learn how to access and use it once delivered.

Typical applications like VPNs or specialized browsers are just another form of tunneling network traffic.

#### Lateral Movement
Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment. Lateral movement can also help us gain access to specific domain resources we may need to elevate our privileges. Lateral Movement often enables privilege escalation across hosts.

#### Pivoting
Utilizing multiple hosts to cross `network` boundaries you would not usually have access to. This is more of a targeted objective. The goal here is to allow us to move deeper into a network by compromising targeted hosts or infrastructure.

#### Tunneling
We often find ourselves using various protocols to shuttle traffic in/out of a network where there is a chance of our traffic being detected. For example, using HTTP to mask our Command & Control traffic from a server we own to the victim host. The key here is obfuscation of our actions to avoid detection for as long as possible. We utilize protocols with enhanced security measures such as HTTPS over TLS or SSH over other transport protocols. These types of actions also enable tactics like the exfiltration of data out of a target network or the delivery of more payloads and instructions into the network.

### Port Forwarding
`Port forwarding` is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.
#### SSH  Local Port Forwarding

We have our attack host (10.10.15.x) and a target Ubuntu server (10.129.x.x), which we have compromised. We will scan the target Ubuntu server using Nmap to search for open ports.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sT -p22,3306 10.129.202.64

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-24 12:12 EST

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.68 seconds
```

SSH port is open. To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, or we can port forward it to our localhost on port `1234` and access it locally. A benefit of accessing it locally is, if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, we won't be able to do it without port forwarding. This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port `3306`. So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

ubuntu@10.129.202.64's password:

The `-L` command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port `1234` to `localhost:3306` on the Ubuntu server. By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.
#### Confirming Port Forward with Netstat
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ netstat -antp | grep 1234

```

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the `local port:server:port` argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on `8080`.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

#### Setting up to Pivot

Now, if you type `ifconfig` on the Ubuntu host, you will find that this server has multiple NICs:

- One connected to our attack host (`ens192`)
- One communicating to other hosts within a different network (`ens224`)
- The loopback interface (`lo`).

```c
ubuntu@WEB01:~$ ifconfig 

ens192: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

```

In our current scenario, we don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. So, we can scan smaller ranges of IPs on the network (`172.16.5.1-200`) network or the entire subnet (`172.16.5.0/23`). We cannot perform this scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the `172.16.5.0/23` network. To do this, we will have to perform `dynamic port forwarding` and `pivot` our network packets via the Ubuntu server. We can do this by starting a `SOCKS listener` on our `local host` (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the network (172.16.5.0/23) after connecting to the target host.

This is called `SSH tunneling` over `SOCKS proxy`. SOCKS stands for `Socket Secure`, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place. Unlike most cases where you would initiate a connection to connect to a service, in the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.

This technique is often used to circumvent the restrictions put in place by firewalls, and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment. One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from `NAT networks`. SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: `SOCKS4` and `SOCKS5`. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that. Let's take an example of the below image where we have a NAT'd network of 172.16.5.0/23, which we cannot access directly.

![](https://i.imgur.com/227v1yN.png)

The attack host starts the SSH client and requests the SSH server to allow it to send some TCP data over the ssh socket. The SSH server responds with an acknowledgment, and the SSH client then starts listening on `localhost:9050`. Whatever data you send here will be broadcasted to the entire network (172.16.5.0/23) over SSH. We can use the below command to perform this dynamic port forwarding.

#### Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

The `-D` argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port `9050`. We can do this using the tool `proxychains`, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through TOR, SOCKS, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. Proxychains is often used to force an application's `TCP traffic` to go through hosted proxies like `SOCKS4`/`SOCKS5`, `TOR`, or `HTTP`/`HTTPS` proxies.

To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf`. We can add `socks4 127.0.0.1 9050` to the last line if it is not already there.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf

# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```
