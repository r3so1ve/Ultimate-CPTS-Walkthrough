## Risk Management Process

| Step                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Identifying the Risk` | Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.                                                                 |
| `Analyze the Risk`     | Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.                     |
| `Evaluate the Risk`    | Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).             |
| `Dealing with Risk`    | Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.        |
| `Monitoring Risk`      | All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, `i.e., from low to medium or high impact`. |
## Red Team vs Blue Team
<span style="color:#fe1616">Red teamers</span> usually play an adversary role in breaking into the organization to identify any potential weaknesses real attackers may utilize to break the organization's defenses. The most common task on the red teaming side is penetration testing, social engineering, and other similar offensive techniques.

On the other hand, the <span style="color:#009dff">blue team</span> makes up the majority of infosec jobs. It is responsible for strengthening the organization's defenses by analyzing the risks, coming up with policies, responding to threats and incidents, and effectively using security tools and other similar tasks.

A [virtual private network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) allows us to connect to a private (internal) network and access hosts and resources as if we were directly connected to the target private network. It is a secured communications channel over shared public networks to connect to a private network (i.e., an employee remotely connecting to their company's corporate network from their home). VPNs provide a degree of privacy and security by encrypting communications over the channel to prevent eavesdropping and access to data traversing the channel.

## Common Terms
<span style="color:#00ff73">Shell</span> - program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function.

|**Shell Type** | **Description**|
|`Reverse shell` | Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.
|`Bind shell` | "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.
|`Web shell` | Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command.

<span style="color:#00ff73">Ports</span> are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).

<span style="color:#00ff73">Web server</span> is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the `HTTP` traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser.
